## Dynamic Programming
Tabulation:
Tabulation is a bottom-up approach. It starts by solving the lowest level subproblem. The solution then lets us solve the next subproblem, and so forth. We iteratively solve all subproblems in this way until we've solved all subproblems, thus finding the solution to the original problem.
